Coursera-MLBase
===============

I am following along with https://www.coursera.org/course/ml to familiarize myself with MLBase, and hopefully implement some useful algorithms therein.

from https://github.com/AustinBGibbons/MLI and https://github.com/AustinBGibbons/MLI, run `./sbt/sbt publish-local` (though currently there are not different from the upstream repos).
